Node, Express, React, Typescript, PostgreSQL - Full stack notes app, where you can create edit and delete notes.

I used ElephantSQL to create my db and the tables, elephantSQL is a hosting free service for postgreeSQL, that makes easy to set up and maintain the database.

I also used Prisma, prisma is an open source sever-side library that helps developers read and write data to the database.
